# Arrays reflection

1. I'm feeling pretty confident with arrays so far, it took me __a lot__ of effort and time to get comfortable with them but I'm feeling like I understand them pretty well now.
2. I want to get more comfortable with array methods because I want to understand them a little better than I do currently. They were the biggest hang up for me during this lesson.
3. I want to know how they're used in practice, that usually helps me get a better understanding of things.
